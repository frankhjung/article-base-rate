## COVID-19 Hospitalizations

COVID-19 hospitalization data is openly reported but the information provided is
being misrepresented. Take for example the following
[Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgraeme.little.9849%2Fposts%2F2156196067868725):

While accurate with regards to the numbers, Little is implying that vaccination
does not work as more people are in hospital who have been vaccinated than those
that have not. This is a dis-representation because the empathizes Little makes
is on the _absolute number_ rather than the rate of the vaccinated vs
un-vaccinated.

As an example let's use some data roughly in accordance with the figures
available from the same source as Little's, namely NSW health.

```{r nsw-hospitalisations}
tot_pop <- 1000
vax_pop <- 0.929 * tot_pop
unvax_pop <- (1 - 0.929) * tot_pop

vax_hos <- sum (2627, 215)
unvax_hos <- sum (315, 55)

vax_death <- 67
unvax_death <- 21
```

Rate of un-vaccinated in hospital is:

```{r unvax}
unvax_rate <- unvax_hos / unvax_pop
unvax_rate
```

Rate of vaccinated in hospital is:

```{r vax}
vax_rate <- vax_hos / vax_pop
vax_rate
```
